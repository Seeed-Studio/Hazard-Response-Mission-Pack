# Integrator Handbook

![basecamp interface](/img/basecamp-interface.png)

The **Mission Pack** is a versatile toolkit designed for disaster response, allowing users to quickly and efficiently react to emergencies without relying on external power or network connections. Its low-power sensors and the plug-and-play support of the Basecamp ensure the system remains operational even in critical conditions.

At the core of the Mission Pack is the **Basecamp**, a highly expandable platform that integrates various products tailored to different disaster scenarios. The Basecamp’s strength lies in its ability to seamlessly incorporate a wide range of devices and sensors, making it adaptable to numerous applications.

**Node-RED** serves as the brain of the Basecamp—a visual programming and low-code IoT platform that enables users to perform data collection, processing, storage, and interface development without extensive coding. With Node-RED and pre-built product flows, the Mission Pack can quickly integrate new devices and extend its functionality.

By completing the [Quick Start - Workshop](/docs/jumpstart-usage/README.md), you should have gained a basic understanding of the Mission Pack, including how to connect sensors, integrate devices, share flows, and reuse components. Most importantly, you should now know how to manage your data streams by modifying the flows (Node-RED programs).

In this **Integrator Handbook**, you will delve deeper into the Mission Pack’s capabilities and explore its full potential beyond the initial workshop. This guide will help you:

1. Gain a better understanding of what the Mission Pack system does.
2. Develop a deep understanding of Node-RED flows.
3. Learn how to integrate new devices into the system.
4. Acquire the skills to build a Mission Pack on your own.

To start, ensure you have a basic understanding of Node-RED by reviewing the [Node-RED Tutorial](./node-red-tutorials/README.md). Next, familiarize yourself with the [System Diagram](./system-diagram/README.md).

After gaining an overview of the Mission Pack, you may want to integrate devices not currently provided by the Mission Pack or those from other manufacturers. Begin by reading [Integrate More Devices](./system-diagram/integrate-more-devices.md), which details how to connect various devices to the Basecamp and expand the system’s capabilities. Each device connection method is covered in detail, explaining the integration process and potential applications.

By understanding how to integrate each device into the Basecamp, you can tailor the Mission Pack to meet specific needs. Every product has unique characteristics and connection requirements, and this handbook provides step-by-step instructions for each.
